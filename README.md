# Lab2M
Tasks and the way they are split
We will continue working with the Fraction class and myArrayList from the previous lab. Inside
your class, define the class myListIterator and implement the following methods:
Abdirahman
hasNext() boolean Returns true if next will not throw an exception
Abdirahman
hasPrevious()boolean Returns true if previous will not throw an exception
Liban
next()Fraction Returns the next object and moves the iterator forward
Liban
previous()Fraction Returns the previous object and moves the iterator backward
Aidan
addAll(Fraction[] frc)
boolean
Inserts all the Franctions from the input array into the list just before the item
that would be returned by the next call to method next and after the item that
would have been returned by method previous
Ali
